<!-- My name is Rouhin Mitra and I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I'm a member of the [UCLA hydro lab](https://www.cee.ucla.edu/hydro/). My research interests lie in the intersection of climate and agriculture where I study the land-atmosphere interactions to quantify agricultural water use and demand. I'm advised by [Prof. Mekonnen Gebremichael](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/mekonnen-gebremichael/). To know more about my work, check out my [talks](https://rouhinmitra.github.io/talks) and [publications](https://rouhinmitra.github.io/publications).  -->
Hi, I’m Rouhin Mitra, a PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I am part of the [UCLA hydro lab](https://www.cee.ucla.edu/hydro/). My research interests are centered at the intersection of climate and agriculture. Specifically, I explore the land-atmosphere interactions that drive agricultural water use and demand. My work involves leveraging satellite data and in-situ observations to quantify these interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving water management practices. I’m advised by [Prof. Mekonnen Gebremichael](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/mekonnen-gebremichael/).

If you’re curious about my academic journey and contributions, feel free to check out my [publications](https://rouhinmitra.github.io/publications).
## Skills 
<!-- My research involves data from a combination of in-situ sensors and satellite imagery to which I apply data driven approaches to develop validation frameworks and tools for agriculutural water management. Currently, I'm building [Irriquate](https://irriquate.org/) which is a platform to help growers in California with their agricultural water management.  -->
In my research I integrate data-driven methodologies with physical observations, combining in-situ sensors and satellite imagery. I apply machine learning techniques and geospatial analysis to build frameworks for validating models for agricultural water management. Currently I'm building [Irriquate](https://irriquate.org/), a platform designed to support California growers in managing their agricultural water needs more effectively. Through Irriquate, we aim to provide tools that bridge the gap between scientific research and practical, field-based water management decisions.

## Past Experiences and Hobbies
<!-- Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dennis Lettenmaier](https://geog.ucla.edu/person/dennis-lettenmaier/) and I was also a GeoField Fellow at [AIDDATA](https://www.geofield.org/) for a brief duration. I grew up in Kolkata, India. I love to play sports and spend my free time playing soccer and tennis. Sometimes, I solve sudoku's and other [puzzles](https://alokgoyal1971.com/) -->

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dennis Lettenmaier](https://geog.ucla.edu/person/dennis-lettenmaier/) on research projects involving water resources management and hydrological modeling. I also was a GeoField Fellow at [AIDDATA](https://www.geofield.org/), where I worked on geospatial data analysis for global development projects.
