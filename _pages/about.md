My name is Rouhin Mitra and I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I'm a member of the [UCLA hydro lab](https://www.cee.ucla.edu/hydro/). My research interests lie in the intersection of climate and agriculture where I study the land-atmosphere interactions to quantify agricultural water use and demand. I'm advised by [Prof. Mekonnen Gebremichael](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/mekonnen-gebremichael/). To know more about my work, check out my [talks](https://rouhinmitra.github.io/talks) and [publications](https://rouhinmitra.github.io/publications). 

## Skills 
My research involves data from a combination of in-situ sensors and satellite imagery to which I apply data driven approaches to develop validation frameworks and tools for agriculutural water management. Currently, I'm building [Irriquate](https://irriquate.org/) which is a platform to help growers in California with their agricultural water management. The prototype can be found [here](https://ee-rouhinmitraucla.projects.earthengine.app/view/nsf-convergence)

## Past Experiences
Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dennis Lettenmaier](https://geog.ucla.edu/person/dennis-lettenmaier/) and I was also a GeoField Fellow at [AIDDATA](https://www.geofield.org/) for a brief duration. 

I grew up in Kolkata, India. I love to play sports and spend my free time playing soccer and tennis. Sometimes, I solve sudoku's and other [puzzles](https://alokgoyal1971.com/)
